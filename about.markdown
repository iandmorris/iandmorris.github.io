My name is Ian Morris and I've been working with embedded systems for over 25 years.
I started my career designing hardware for office and industrial equipment, before
moving onto firmware development for automotive products. About 15 years ago I moved
to the semiconductor industry and have since worked in a variety of applications roles
on both Microcontroller and wireless connectivity products such as ZigBee, Bluetooth LE
and WiFi.
